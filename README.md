I made this game for my son, currently 2.5-years-old and loves shapes and colors. It's been a great and fun exercise in Vanilla JS and CSS. It will be continuous practice in delivering a seamless experience whether on desktop or mobile, and is a work-in-progress. Always happy to receive feedback or ideas on how to improve!
